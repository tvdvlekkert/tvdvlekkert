# About Me
I've worked on various robotics programs for a bit over a decade with mixed hardware and software emphasis. I [made fire](https://youtu.be/0zOzk0keqU8) at SpaceX, [played with sensors](https://aurora.tech/blog/meet-fusion-the-aurora-drivers-next-generation) at Uber Advanced Technology Group and Aurora Innovation, and crunched flight analysis at Astra. I'm currently data engineering at Glydways. Weapons of choice: Python and C++.
