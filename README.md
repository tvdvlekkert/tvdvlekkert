# About Me
I have a little over a decade of professional experience working in various hardware and software development programs. The first part of my career was spend cutting my teeth at SpaceX as a design & test development engineer for the [Dragon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/) Propulsion Department. This included designing novel automation capabilities for fluid components and [integrated testbeds](https://youtu.be/0zOzk0keqU8). The second part of my career saw a transition to more test and systems engineering at Uber Advanced Technology Group and Aurora Innovation working forthe Hardware Verification & Validation and Architecture Departments. My progression largely mirrored my previous tenure, where I developed automation capabilities for electronics components and later requirements for system-level [sensing technologies](https://aurora.tech/blog/meet-fusion-the-aurora-drivers-next-generation) serving both hardware and software partners.

While my first passion will forever be aerospace, my more recent experience in automotive/technology had an extraordinary impact in my professional interests. I'm currently mid-course into developing more technical expertise into software and bolstering my education in Computer Science; more on that shortly.

This is my personal account. If you see a bunch of commits here in private repos, then I'm either landing stuff for school or pursuing something that I can eventually spin out into an entrepreneurial endeavor. 

# Ongoing Projects
There are a few ongoing projects that I have lined up in various states of development:
- [Robotic](https://www.electromaker.io/shop/product/sparkfun-jetbot-ai-kit-v21-powered-by-jetson-nano) Cat Chaser: train a small robot to map my living room and seek & annoy my cat.
- Neopixel Art Display: building an art installation that can react to music.
- DIY laser light show: do something like [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VL1-lNUQA_I/maxresdefault.jpg).
- Spacecraft Asteroid Mission: replicating an old assignment from undergrad to architect a mission to a nearby asteroid.
