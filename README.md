# About Me
I've worked on various robotics programs for a bit over a decade with an early emphasis on hardware and later emphasis on software. This included time at: SpaceX as a design & test development engineer working on [Dragon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/) [integrated testbeds](https://youtu.be/0zOzk0keqU8), Uber Advanced Technology Group and Aurora Innovation as a test & systems development engineer working on autonomy [sensing](https://aurora.tech/blog/meet-fusion-the-aurora-drivers-next-generation) requirements development, and Astra as asystems engineer working on fully automated data post-processing. I have a strong practical and professional knowledge in Python and am currently in the process of building more confidence in lower-level languages namely C++.

While my first passion will forever be aerospace, my more recent experience in autonomous vehicles has profoundly impacted my professional trajectory. I'm leaning heavily into developing my technical acumen in software. This includes bolstering my education in Computer Science but more on that to come.
