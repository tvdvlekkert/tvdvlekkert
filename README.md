# About Me
I've worked on various robotics programs for a bit over a decade with mixed hardware and software emphasis. This included stints at SpaceX as development engineer [making fire](https://youtu.be/0zOzk0keqU8), Uber Advanced Technology Group and Aurora Innovation [architecting sensing systems](https://aurora.tech/blog/meet-fusion-the-aurora-drivers-next-generation), Astra automating verifications, and Glydways doing something similar. Mostly Python, sometimes C++.
