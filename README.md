# About Me
I've worked on various robotics programs for a bit over a decade with an early emphasis on hardware and later emphasis on software. This included time at: SpaceX as a design & test development engineer working on [integrated testbeds](https://youtu.be/0zOzk0keqU8), Uber Advanced Technology Group and Aurora Innovation as a test & systems development engineer working on [autonomous sensing](https://aurora.tech/blog/meet-fusion-the-aurora-drivers-next-generation) requirements development, and Astra as a systems engineer working on fully automated data post-processing. I have practical knowledge in Python and am building more aptitude in C++.

While my first passion will forever be aerospace, my more recent experience in robotics has profoundly impacted my professional trajectory. Currently I'm leaning heavily into developing my software technical acumen. This includes bolstering my education in Computer Science.
